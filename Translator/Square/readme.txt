Game desciption:

I made changes to the original Square game.
There are rectangles and circles on the screen.
If the moving rectangles go through rectangles, it will become larger.
If the moving rectangles go through circles, it will become smaller.

What the program doesn't implement:

The game only check certain points in the screen, 
so it may be a littel difficult to make it change its size.
